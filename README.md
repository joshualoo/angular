The process: 
I started with the making overall layout of the page. I used Bootstrap make the build process faster. 
As for the directives that I used,
ng-repeat was used to populate the contact list from the JSON object taken from the contact file provided. 
ng-model was used to make the search bar work. 
ng-click is used within ng-repeat and ng-show was used to show the contact info on the right panel
ng-show and ng-hide was used to make the contact info editable. The ng-show and ng-hide works nicely with the toggling and showing the input values for editing.
